Goes well with horseradish sauce (mix prepared horseradish and sour cream—amounts depend on desired flavor). This will yield a lot of fat in the pan. Unlike many meats, the pan drippings from this roast beef are not particularly good. To clean up—either drain off into a can or something you can throw away, or wait until it congeals and dispose of it then. This will also work with a boneless roast, but is better with a bone-in roast because the bone adds a lot of flavor."

Remember that filet is all edible (no bone), so you can calculate pretty accurately. Low sodium soy sauce works just as well as regular soy sauce, and is better for you. The average whole tenderloin is 4-5 lbs. If you want to feed a smaller group, you have two choices. You can buy a whole one and freeze part of it for later use. Or you can buy a center cut filet, which is pretty much what it sounds like—the center portion of a whole filet—about 2 lbs. They generally charge more per pound for the center cut, but you don’t wind up with a lot more meat than you need. When I bake this, I move it to a real roasting pan. I don’t bake it in the pyrex. Serve this with horseradish sauce. Mix prepared horseradish and sour cream. Amounts of each depend on taste preference."
