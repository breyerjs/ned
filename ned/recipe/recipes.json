Goes well with horseradish sauce (mix prepared horseradish and sour cream—amounts depend on desired flavor). This will yield a lot of fat in the pan. Unlike many meats, the pan drippings from this roast beef are not particularly good. To clean up—either drain off into a can or something you can throw away, or wait until it congeals and dispose of it then. This will also work with a boneless roast, but is better with a bone-in roast because the bone adds a lot of flavor."

Remember that filet is all edible (no bone), so you can calculate pretty accurately. Low sodium soy sauce works just as well as regular soy sauce, and is better for you. The average whole tenderloin is 4-5 lbs. If you want to feed a smaller group, you have two choices. You can buy a whole one and freeze part of it for later use. Or you can buy a center cut filet, which is pretty much what it sounds like—the center portion of a whole filet—about 2 lbs. They generally charge more per pound for the center cut, but you don’t wind up with a lot more meat than you need. When I bake this, I move it to a real roasting pan. I don’t bake it in the pyrex. Serve this with horseradish sauce. Mix prepared horseradish and sour cream. Amounts of each depend on taste preference."

The best lemons are the small skinny ones (hence the name) because they have the most juice. If all you can find are large ones with a thick skin (and not as much juice), you may want to cut them in half to allow as much juice as possible to come out. According to Ms. Hazan, this chicken is supposed to puff up like a balloon, making a fabulous presentation. It has never done that for me, but it always tastes wonderful—puffed or not. Pan juices are fabulous. Spoon them over the meat. I like to serve this with rice pilaf."

I use about 1 pound. Don’t worry about getting the perfect amount of garlic—more is better. You may want to increase the amount of wine and lemon juice (maybe to ¼ cup each). Just keep them the same amount of each. If you increase these amounts, you may need to take an extra few minutes to reduce them to the right consistency. I like to serve this with rice casserole."

As you peel the potatoes, put them in the pot of water you’re going to boil them in so they don’t turn brown, which they will if they just sit in the air. You can make this up the day before, bring to room temperature, add marshmallows and bake when you want to serve them. Personally, I think they’re better, though, made the day you serve them."
